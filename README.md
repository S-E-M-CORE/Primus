Primus is a modern membership management system developed as a school project. It's designed to replace the outdated Excel 97 version for the fictional "Der glühende Colt" shooting club. With a user-friendly interface, Primus streamlines member management tasks effortlessly.

Note: Primus is a work in progress and solely created for educational purposes. The scenario described is fictional.
